NAME
       mako - configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The config file is located at ~/.config/mako/config or at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mako/config. Option lines can be specified to configure mako like so:

           key=value

       Empty lines and lines that begin with # are ignored.

GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       max-history=n
           Set maximum number of expired notifications to keep in the history buffer to n. If the buffer is full, newly expired notifications replace the oldest ones. If
           0, history is disabled.

           Default: 5

       sort=+/-time | +/-priority
           Sorts incoming notifications by time and/or priority in ascending(+) or descending(-) order.

           Default: -time

       include=config path
           Includes a config at the specified path. The path must be absolute or otherwise start with ~/.

           Default: none

BINDING OPTIONS
       Bindings allow one to perform an action when an event is triggered.

       Supported options:

       on-button-left=action
           Performs the action when the left pointer button is pressed.

           Default: invoke-default-action

       on-button-middle=action
           Performs the action when the middle pointer button is pressed.

           Default: none

       on-button-right=action
           Performs the action when the right pointer button is pressed.

           Default: dismiss

       on-touch=action
           Performs the action when tapped via a touch device.

           Default: dismiss

       on-notify=action
           Performs the action when the notification is opened.

           Default: none

       Supported actions:

       none
           Do nothing.

       dismiss [--no-history]
           Dismiss the current notification. If --no-history is passed, the notification won't be added to history.

       dismiss-all
           Dismiss all notifications.

       dismiss-group
           Dismiss notifications in the current group.

       invoke-action <action>
           Invoke the named action on the notification.

           An  xdg-activation  token  will  be  sent to the client, allowing the client to request focus from the compositor. The compositor must support the xdg_activa‐
           tion_v1 protocol and allow the focus request for the following example to work correctly:

               [app-name="some-app-id" actionable]
               on-button-left=invoke-action mail-reply-sender

       invoke-default-action
           Invoke the default action on the notification.

       exec <command>
           Execute a shell command.

           The command will be executed in a POSIX shell. The shell variable id will be set to the notification ID. For example, the following option will display an in‐
           teractive action menu on middle click:

               on-button-middle=exec makoctl menu -n "$id" dmenu -p 'Select action: '

           The following option will play a sound when a new notification is opened:

               on-notify=exec mpv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga

STYLE OPTIONS
       font=font
           Set font to font, as a Pango font description. For  more  information  on  Pango  font  descriptions,  see:  https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/type_func.FontDescrip‐
           tion.from_string.html#description

           Default: monospace 10

       background-color=color
           Set background color to color. See COLORS for more information.

           Default: #285577FF

       text-color=color
           Set text color to color. See COLORS for more information.

           Default: #FFFFFFFF

       width=px
           Set width of notification popups.

           Default: 300

       height=px
           Set maximum height of notification popups. Notifications whose text takes up less space are shrunk to fit.

           Default: 100

       outer-margin=directional
           Set  outer-margin  of  each  edge to the size specified by directional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information. This margin applies to the outside of the
           whole notification list.

           Default: 0

       margin=directional
           Set margin of each edge to the size specified by directional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information. This margin applies to  each  individual  notifica‐
           tion. Note that it applies in addition to outer-margin, meaning first and last notifications will use the sum of both margins.

           Default: 10

       padding=directional
           Set padding on each side to the size specified by directional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information.

           Default: 5

       border-size=px
           Set popup border size to px pixels.

           Default: 2

       border-color=color
           Set popup border color to color. See COLORS for more information.

           Default: #4C7899FF

       border-radius=directional
           Set popup corner radius on each side to the size specified by directional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information.

           Default: 0

       progress-color=[over|source] color
           Set  popup  progress indicator color to color. See COLOR for more information. To draw the progress indicator on top of the background color, use the over at‐
           tribute. To replace the background color, use the source attribute (this can be useful when the notification is semi-transparent).

           Progress can be indicated in a notification by setting a hint, "value" to an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive.

           Default: over #5588AAFF

       icons=0|1
           Show icons in notifications.

           Default: 1

       max-icon-size=px
           Set maximum icon size to px pixels.

           Default: 64

       icon-path=path[:path...]
           Paths to search for icons when a notification specifies a name instead of a full path. Colon-delimited. This approximates the search algorithm used by the XDG
           Icon Theme Specification, but does not support any of the theme metadata. Therefore, if you want to search parent themes, you'll need to add them to the  path
           manually.

           The path should be the root of the icon theme, the categories and resolutions will be searched for the most appropriate match.

           /usr/share/icons/hicolor and /usr/share/pixmaps are always searched.

           Default: ""

       icon-location=position
           Position of the icon relative to the displayed text. Valid options are left, right, top and bottom.

           Default: left

       icon-border-radius=px
           Sets icon corner radius to px pixels.

           Default: 0

       markup=0|1
           If 1, enable Pango markup. If 0, disable Pango markup. If enabled, Pango markup will be interpreted in your format specifier and in the body of notifications.

           Default: 1

       actions=0|1
           Applications may request an action to be associated with activating a notification. Disabling this will cause mako to ignore these requests.

           Default: 1

       history=0|1
           If  set, mako will save notifications that have reached their timeout into the history buffer instead of immediately deleting them. max-history determines the
           size of the history buffer.

           Default: 1

       format=format
           Set notification format string to format. See FORMAT SPECIFIERS for more information. To change this for grouped notifications, set it within a grouped crite‐
           ria.

           Default: <b>%s</b>\n%b
           Default when grouped: (%g) <b>%s</b>\n%b

       text-alignment=left|center|right
           Set notification text alignment.

           Default: left

       default-timeout=timeout
           Set the default timeout to timeout in milliseconds. To disable the timeout, set it to zero.

           Default: 0

       ignore-timeout=0|1
           If set, mako will ignore the expire timeout sent by notifications and use the one provided by default-timeout instead.

           Default: 0

       group-by=field[,field,...]
           A comma-separated list of criteria fields that will be compared to other visible notifications to determine if this one should form a  group  with  them.  All
           listed criteria must be exactly equal for two notifications to group.

           Default: none

       max-visible=n
           Set maximum number of visible notifications to n. Older notifications will be hidden. If -1, all notifications are visible.

           Default: 5

       output=name
           Show notifications on the specified output. If empty, notifications will appear on the focused output.

           Requires the compositor to support the Wayland protocol xdg-output-unstable-v1 version 2.

           Default: ""

       layer=layer
           Arrange mako at the specified layer, relative to normal windows. Supported values are background, bottom, top, and overlay. Using overlay will cause notifica‐
           tions to be displayed above fullscreen windows, though this may also occur at top depending on your compositor.

           Default: top

       anchor=position
           Show  notifications  at  the specified position on the output. Supported values are top-right, top-center, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-center, bottom-left,
           center-right, center-left and center.

           Default: top-right

CRITERIA
       In addition to the set of options at the top of the file, the config file may contain zero or more sections, each containing any combination of  the  BINDING  OP‐
       TIONS  and  STYLE  OPTIONS. The sections, called criteria, are defined with an INI-like square bracket syntax. The brackets may contain any number of fields, like
       so:

           [field=value field2=value2 ...]

       When a notification is received, it will be compared to the fields defined in each criteria. If all of the fields match, the style options within will be  applied
       to  the  notification. Fields not included in the criteria are not considered during the match. A notification may match any number of criteria. This matching oc‐
       curs in the order the criteria are defined in the config file, meaning that if multiple criteria match a notification, the last occurrence of any given style  op‐
       tion will "win".

       The following fields are available in criteria:

       •   app-name (string)
       •   app-icon (string)
       •   summary (string): exact match on the summary of the notification. This field conflicts with summary~.
       •   summary~ (string): a POSIX extended regular expression match on the summary of the notification. This field conflicts with summary.
       •   body (string): an exact match on the body of the notification. This field conflicts with body~.
       •   body~ (string): a POSIX extended regular expression match on the body of the notification. This field conflicts with body.
       •   urgency (one of "low", "normal", "critical")
       •   category (string)
       •   desktop-entry (string)
       •   actionable (boolean)
       •   expiring (boolean)
       •   mode (string): only apply style options in this section if the provided mode is currently enabled. For more information about modes, see the MODES section.

       The following fields are also available to match on a second pass based on where previous style options decided to place each notification:

       •   grouped (boolean): whether the notification is grouped with any others.
       •   group-index (int): the notification's index within its group, or -1 if it is not grouped.
       •   hidden (boolean): special field which defines the style for the placeholder shown when the number of notifications or groups exceeds max-visible.
       •   output (string): which output the notification was sorted onto. See the output style option for possible values.
       •   anchor (string): which position on the output the notification was assigned to. See the anchor style option for possible values.

       There are only two passes performed on each notification, so the second-pass criteria are not allowed to reposition the notification.

       If a field's value contains special characters, they may be escaped with a backslash, or quoted:

           [app-name="Google Chrome"]

           [app-name=Google\ Chrome]

       Quotes within quotes may also be escaped, and a literal backslash may be specified as \\. No spaces are allowed around the equal sign. Escaping equal signs within
       values is unnecessary.

       Additionally, boolean values may be specified using any of true/false, 0/1, or as bare words:

           [actionable=true] [actionable=1] [actionable]

           [actionable=false] [actionable=0] [!actionable]

       There are three criteria always present at the front of the list:
       •   An empty criteria which matches all notifications and contains the defaults for all style options, overwritten with any configured in the global section.
       •   [grouped], which sets the default format for grouped notifications and sets them invisible.
       •   [group-index=0], which makes the first member of each group visible again.

       These options can be overridden by simply defining the criteria yourself and overriding them.

       There  are  some rules restricting what can be configured depending on what is being matched by a given criteria. Criteria matching grouped or group-index are not
       allowed to change the anchor, output, or group-by, as this would invalidate the grouping. Grouping is only performed once rather than recursively,  to  avoid  the
       potential for infinite loops.

CRITERIA-ONLY STYLE OPTIONS
       Some style options are not useful in the global context and therefore have no associated command-line option.

       invisible=0|1
           Whether  this notification should be invisible even if it is above the max-visible cutoff. This is used primarily for hiding members of groups. If you want to
           make more than the first group member visible, turn this option off within a group-index criteria.

           Default: 0

COLORS
       Colors can be specified as #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA.

DIRECTIONAL VALUES
       Some options set values that affect all four edges of a notification. These options can be specified in several different ways, depending on how much control over
       each edge is desired:

       •   A single value will apply to all four edges.
       •   Two values will set vertical and horizontal edges separately.
       •   Three will set top, horizontal, and bottom edges separately.
       •   Four will set top, right, bottom, and left edges separately.

       When specifying multiple values, they should be comma-separated. For example, this would set the top margin to 10, left and right to 20, and bottom to five:

           margin = 10,20,5

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       Format specification works similarly to printf(3), but with a different set of specifiers.

       %%   Literal "%"

       \\   Literal "\"

       \n   New Line

   For notifications
       %a   Application name

       %s   Notification summary

       %b   Notification body

       %g   Number of notifications in the current group

       %i   Notification id

   For the hidden notifications placeholder
       %h   Number of hidden notifications

       %t   Total number of notifications

MODES
       mako supports applying style options conditionally via modes. A configuration section with a mode criteria will only be  applied  if  the  current  mode  matches.
       makoctl(1) can be used to change the current mode.

       The initial list of modes contains a single mode called "default". This is deprecated, in a future version the initial list of modes will be empty.

       For example, to hide all notifications if the mode "do-not-disturb" is enabled:

           [mode=do-not-disturb]
           invisible=1

       makoctl mode -a do-not-disturb will hide all notifications, makoctl mode -r do-not-disturb will show them again.
